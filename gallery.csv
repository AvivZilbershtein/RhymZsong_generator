He looks up to the sky above, 
And prays for a miracle. 
The courage of his heart guides him through, 
To a place of safety and peace."

With all the pain they had to keep 

He strummed his strings with such grace 
His music filled every place 
It brought joy and peace of mind 
To those who were blind 
And left them feeling in a daze"
