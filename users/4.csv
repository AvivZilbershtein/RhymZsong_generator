"write a Limerick in the Rock genre about a  in the context of  with only 10 lines, where the max length of a line is 6.0 words and the minimum length is 3.0 words","A rocker who loved to explore
In the context of a great war
He'd play his guitar
And sing from afar
His voice could be heard evermore 

The notes he played were so sweet 
His melodies made people weep 
He sang of courage and hope 
That helped them cope 
With all the pain they had to keep 

He strummed his strings with such grace 
His music filled every place 
It brought joy and peace of mind 
To those who were blind 
And left them feeling in a daze"
