"write a Poem in the Country genre about a Guy in Lava field in the context of medieval times with only 10 lines, where the max length of a line is 6.0 words and the minimum length is 3.0 words","Lava field, so vast and wide 
A man of courage, brave and bold 
He stands alone in the night's dark sky 
His heart is strong, his spirit high 
The heat of lava, he does not fear 
For he knows his fate is near 
His courage will be tested this day 
As he faces what comes his way 
He'll fight with all his might and strength 
To protect his land at any length."
