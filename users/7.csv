Loved to play in the moonlight
He'd strum his guitar
And sing from afar
To the stars in the night

His music was loud and strong
It echoed out all night long
He'd play for hours
And never cower
His passion was so strong

His songs were full of emotion
He'd play with such devotion
The crowd would cheer
As he'd appear
His music was his devotion

He'd play with such finesse
His music was a caress
He'd make the crowd sway
In a rock-filled day
His music was his success"
